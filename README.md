# VideoPlayer

This player is part of a video from [Mario Souto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omariosouto/) from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) and consists on a videoplayer made with [React](https://reactjs.org). As a challenge, [Mario Souto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omariosouto/) asked us to implement the Playback Rate on Video Player.
